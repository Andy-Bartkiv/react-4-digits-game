To practice three interesting aspects of Software Engineering: 
1. Develop highly interactive game interface in React, flavoured with nice animations.
2. Explore some back-end tech, like Node.js, Express and WebSocket, to provide multiplayer game mode.
3. Invent and implement (which was extremely challenging) good AI code-breaking algorithm.

44 Code Breaking Game 
is a variation of Bulls and Cows code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind.

The game is played in turns by two opponents who aim to decipher the other's secret code by trial and error.

The first player to reveal the other's secret number wins the game.

It is proved that any number can be solved within seven turns.

Because the game has simple rules while still being difficult and entertaining, there are many computer variants.
A computer program moo, written in 1970 by J. M. Grochow at MIT, was among the first Bulls and Cows computer implementations.
